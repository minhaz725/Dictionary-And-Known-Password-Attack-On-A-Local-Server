#Dictionary and Known Password Attack
Known password attack is typically a guessing
attack which uses a precompiled list of options.
Rather than trying every option, only try
complete options which are likely to work.
Dictionary attack is kinda similar but it uses a
precompiled dictionary wordlist.
Details can be found in 'CSE 406 Project Final Report'
